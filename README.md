# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page AJAX-based Twitter clone. It uses jQuery, HTML5 and CSS3 to make it fun for our users to experience.

Currently, anyone may make a tweet. No need for an account! Go ahead and try it yourself.

run `npm install` to get the following dependencies to properly run the app:

```
body-parser     - ^1.15.2
chance          - ^1.0.2
express         - ^4.13.4
md5             - ^2.1.0
mongodb         - ^2.2.35
moment          - ^2.22.1
moment-timezone - ^0.5.17
```
Once you have downloaded all the files, run the following while within the tweeter directory:
```
 npm run local
```

You may then head over [here](http://localhost:8080/) and play with the app!
